## Project Ideas

- Removing all text from a webpage (wordless internet)
- Every default profile pic img replaced with something funny / cute / inspiring
- Make all elements on page randomly bounce around
- Background image transitioning across the page
- Change all words on page to another language (to pig latin? https://funtranslations.com/api/pig-latin?context=piglatin&component=API) \*\*
- Change styling of all elements (random colors?)
- Timer extension for stretching hands (too much typing) / resting eyes
